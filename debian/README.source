Debian packaging of LinuxCNC/Mesaflash
======================================

The following steps were performed to transform Upstream's git repository
into a source tarball and to provide a debian subdirectory that shines
for the main distribution. The major obstacle is that Mesaflash is
already used across a wide span of distributions, from Wheezy  (Jessie
anyone?) up to the latest Ubuntu releases. Not too many changes are
required for Debian unstable.

Steps
-----

1. Generate the source tarball

   debian/rules get-orig-source

2. Prepare shell to work in temp directory

   export WORKDIR=$(mktemp -d)
   mv mesaflash_*.orig.tar.xz ${WORKDIR}/
   bash
   cd $WORKDIR

2. Unpack

   tar xJvf mesaflash_*.orig.tar.xz

3. Slightly adapt for unstable

   bash
   cd $WORKDIR/mesaflash
   rm debian/compat
   sed -i 's/debhelper .*,/debhelper-compat (= 13),/' debian/control
   sed -i '/^Standards-Version: /s/ [0-9.]*/ 4.6.0/' debian/control
   sed -i '1s/ stable;/ unstable;/' debian/changelog

4. build Debian package

   dpkg-buildpackage

5. get all the files just created

   exit
   mv ${WORKDIR}/mesaflash_* ..


Above sketched differences are not impeding routine workflows of Debian
packaging. For instance we found that the routine-update script (from the
Debian Science team) deals with these adaptations just fine.
