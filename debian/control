Description: Mesa Electronics utility tool
 This package provides a tool for the configuration and/or diagnosis of
 Mesa Electronics boards. The cards provide I/O channels for robotics
 applications and have a strong user base in the LinuxCNC community.
 This tool works for all cards, be they directly plugged into your
 computer via PCI(E) or connected by a cable (ETH/EPP/USB/SPI).
